        <h2>About Me.</h2>
        <p>My name is Kristen Scheel and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College.</p>
      
        <p>Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained experience with a
        variety
        of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma, and Sketch.</p>
      
        <p>I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to experiment with
        other
        areas of design, such as motion graphics and web design.</p>

            <h4>Logo Creation</h4>
            <p>Your logo is the face of your brand and the first thing that potential customers will see, so it's crucial to
            make a great first impression. I can help create a logo that is both visually stunning and effective in representing your
            brand.</p>

            first
            impression. I can help you create a website that not only looks great but also functions flawlessly and engages

            <h4>Full Branding</h4>
            <p>Your brand is much more than just a logo or a website. It's the overall image that your business presents to the
            world,
            including the look, feel, and voice of your brand. I can help you create a cohesive and impactful brand that
            resonates
            with your target audience and sets you apart from your competitors.</p>
